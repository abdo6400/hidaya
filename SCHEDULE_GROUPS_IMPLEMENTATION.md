# Schedule Groups System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the new Schedule Groups system for the Hidaya Flutter app. The system replaces the old single-day schedule approach with a more flexible multi-day group system.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Schedule Groups
- **Multi-day schedules**: Groups can include multiple days (e.g., Monday + Wednesday + Friday)
- **Flexible time slots**: Multiple time slots per day with category assignments
- **Group management**: Create, edit, and manage schedule groups
- **Conflict detection**: Prevents overlapping schedules for the same sheikh

### 2. Child Assignment System
- **Group assignments**: Children can be assigned to specific schedule groups
- **Pivot table**: `group_children` collection manages child-group relationships
- **Assignment tracking**: Track when children are assigned and any notes

### 3. Task Management
- **Individual task assignments**: Each child can have specific tasks assigned
- **Progress tracking**: Track task completion status (pending, in progress, completed)
- **Marks and scoring**: Assign marks to completed tasks
- **Bulk assignments**: Assign multiple tasks to multiple children at once

### 4. Progress Tracking & Analytics
- **Child progress**: Individual progress statistics for each child
- **Group progress**: Overall group performance metrics
- **Ranking system**: Children ranked within groups based on performance
- **Completion rates**: Track task completion percentages

### 5. User Dashboards

#### Sheikh Dashboard
- **Groups overview**: List all schedule groups with child counts
- **Group details**: View children, schedules, and progress for each group
- **Task management**: Assign and manage tasks for children
- **Progress monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and rankings

#### Parent Dashboard
- **Children overview**: List all children belonging to the parent
- **Group information**: Show which groups each child belongs to
- **Progress tracking**: Individual child progress and performance metrics
- **Task completion**: View completed and pending tasks

## üìä Database Structure

### New Collections

#### 1. `schedule_groups`
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "sheikhId": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "days": [
    {
      "day": "monday",
      "timeSlots": [
        {
          "startTime": "09:00",
          "endTime": "10:00",
          "categoryId": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

#### 2. `group_children` (Pivot Table)
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "groupId": "string",
  "childId": "string",
  "assignedAt": "timestamp",
  "isActive": true,
  "notes": "string"
}
```

#### 3. `child_tasks`
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "childId": "string",
  "taskId": "string",
  "groupId": "string",
  "status": "pending|inProgress|completed",
  "mark": "number",
  "assignedAt": "timestamp",
  "completedAt": "timestamp",
  "notes": "string",
  "assignedBy": "string"
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

2. Clicks "+" to create new group
3. Enters group name and description
4. Selects multiple days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
5. Adds time slots for each day
6. Selects categories for each time slot
7. System checks for conflicts
8. Group is created and appears in dashboard

### Assigning Children to Groups

2. Children complete tasks
3. Sheikh marks tasks as completed with scores
4. Progress is automatically calculated
5. Rankings are updated in real-time
6. Parents can view progress in their dashboard

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Group Names**: Currently showing group IDs instead of names in some places
2. **Child Names**: Need to fetch child names for ranking display
3. **Task Templates**: No predefined task templates yet
4. **Bulk Operations**: Limited bulk assignment capabilities
5. **Offline Support**: No offline functionality implemented
